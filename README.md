# Angular9
## Get started
# FrontApi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.0.
### Clone the repo

```shell
* git clone https://github.com/jainnimish7/angular9-laravel-boilerplate.git
* cd angular9-laravel-boilerplate
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
* npm install
* npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript), and watches for changes to the source files, and runs `server` on port `4200`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

#### Make sure to install angular v9 as @angular/cli by

```shell
* npm install -g @angular/cli@9.0.0
```

#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
* `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
* `npm run build:prod` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "production mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into `dist/`.
* `npm run build:staging` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "staging mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into `dist/`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
